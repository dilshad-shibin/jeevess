<p>I wanted to write to say thank you for making me feel better in just 10 days of life in Jeevess Ayurvedic Hospital, Wayanad Vythiri. It was an amazing experience in my life I have been to many Ayurvedic hospitals in Kerala but the service and treatment provided by Jeevess Ayurvedic hospital was remarkable even though it is an Ayurvedic hospital I felt like home throughout the treatment process.</p>
<p>The medical service I received from Dr.Shree Lal Shankar in your hospital was exceptional. His polite and gentle character is also one of the main medicine to the patients who come there with the purpose of cure. He made my well-being his primary focus and I was always satisfied with the care he provided.</p>
<p>Dr.Niyas was the one who suggested me to Jeevess Ayurvedic hospital. He was very helpful in the whole admission process.</p>
<p>Dr.Saheer Ali was very helpful in guiding me about my health. He even suggested and gave me guidelines to take care of my health issues even Dr.Anamika Ashok was always been there for any help if required.</p>
<p>I would even like to highlight Dietician Poornima who was physically not present but still took efforts to contact me over the phone and give me a proper healthy diet plan to follow here after.I would even like to highlight Dietician Poornima who was physically not present but still took efforts to contact me over the phone and give me a proper healthy diet plan to follow here after.</p>
<p>Even the yoga chief Abdul Salam had done a great job, my massage treatment experience was remarkable I even got more knowledge about yoga and its benefits.</p>
<p>Talking about the Manager Jolly Thomas, he was like a great companion throughout the whole process. He took well care of me, he kept calling me to ensure I don’t get lost in the premises. He used to come and pick me up from my cottage for breakfast, lunch, dinner and treatment.</p>
<p>The food provided by Jeevess Ayurvedic Hospital was amazing, cooked with locally sourced veggies and natural food which is very good for health.</p>
<p>I would like to give few suggestions as a patient who has been with Jeevess Ayurvedic hospital for 10 days</p>
<p>1. As there is steam bath in the treatment room washroom an exhaust fan should be there.</p>
<p>2. Keep Qibla marking in every room if possible.</p>
<p>3. Doctor should visit the patients</p>
<p>4. Beside the cupboard there is a shelf which is meant for shoes I believe it could be dangerous as it is loose and can fall on anyone’s leg.</p>
<p>I’m extremely pleased with the top-notch care I received from everyone. I would definitely suggest Jeevess Ayurvedic Hospital to anyone who is going through any kind of illness and looking for cure.
Hope to visit you all again with a better health condition</p>
<p>Your Sincerely</p>
<p>K.U. Hashim</p>
