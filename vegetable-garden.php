<h5>At Jeevess, we grow our vegetables in an organic way and serve them freshly from Jeevess vegetable garden. </h5>
<p>The Ayurvedic texts have mentioned about the vegetables by the group named ‘shaaka varga’ – meaning vegetable groups. The whole group of vegetables as we know, are classified into different classifications and includes</p>
<ul class="inr_bult mt-4 mb-4">
<li>Patra (Leafy vegetables)</li>  
<li>Pushpa (Flowering vegetables)</li>  
<li>Phala (Fruit vegetables)</li>  
<li>Nala (Stalk vegetables)</li>  
<li>Kanda (Tuber vegetables)</li>  
</ul>
<p>During the treatments to promote health, consumption of vegetables plays a vital role in curing diseases. During the treatment regime, there are dictums called pathya meaning what is good and apathya means what is not good in the healing process. The pathya (wholesome) things can be the food they eat, it can be the activity or the medicine they take. It is important to have the right type of food for the right condition, properly processed and prepared in the right way, in the right time to have the most benefit out of treatments.
</p>
<p>In this way, vegetables are cultivated under the directions of the doctors and dieticians. We have planted the commonly used vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, brinjal, ash gourd, pumpkin, ladies finger, tomatoes in clusters planted at various areas of Jeevess hospital.</p>
